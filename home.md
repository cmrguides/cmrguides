#### We'd like to take a moment to welcome you in to the NEW Console Modding & Repair guides / community.

Formerly Jailbreak All In One (JBAIO), we stand with the same aim! To create a perfect centre for everything console related, but this time, with a little more structure and attention to detail. 

We're now using a much simpler to use wiki based software with some fantastic features for our contributors. This means we can add lots of content, much faster than we could before. 

Please, take a look around and watch this communtiy grow! It's only with the support of our developers and contributors that this project is possible. So we'd like to explicitly thank every person that's involved. 

You might not see much content here at the moment as we're very new, but it's coming...

Please feel free to get in on the converstation over on our <a href="https://discord.gg/xFZRazxP">Discord Channel</a> <i class="mdi mdi-discord"></i>. It still contains the old JBAIO stuff as well!

> cmrguides does not and will never endorse piracy. Developers work incredibly hard on games and content and piracy is currently killing these wonderful people. We will check this periodically and remove it immediatley if this occurs.<br>
> There is a big difference between modifying and exploiting the hardware you own; taking advantage of development weaknesess, and using the modifications to execute pirated material. We need to maintain this ethic in order to keep our site & community running leagally and fairly.<br>
