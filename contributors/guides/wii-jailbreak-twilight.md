## Introduction
<b>This guide will show you how to load LetterBomb, install the Homebrew Channel & jailbreak your Wii.</b>

> This method should work with both the original wii (with GC ports), and the second revision (without GC ports).
<br><b>It will not work on the Wii Mini.</b> 
{.is-info}

## Things you'll need
Before starting you'll need to ensure you have:
- An SD Card which is 4GB or larger.
- A computer with an SD card reader or a USB SD card reader.
- A Wi-Fi connection for your Wii to connect to.

---

## Preparing the SD Card
To start, you'll need to prepare your SD Card so that the Wii can read it. To do this, you'll need to format the SD Card. In this case you'll need to format it using the FAT32 file system. 

> Other file system types will not work!
{.is-warning}

## Checking your Wii System Software version
Next, you'll need to check your Wii System Software Version. 

<b>This is important, so make a note of this. </b>

Click the Wii button thats on the bottom-left of the Wii menu, then select Wii Settings. You'll see it in the top-right corner.

> It needs to be version 4.3 followed by U, J, E or K. The letters correspond to the region of the console.
{.is-info}

If your system is running an earlier version, you'll need to update this in the settings using Wii System Update.

## Checking your Wii Mac Address
You'll now need to check your Wii Mac Address. 

<b>Again, this is important, so make a note of this. </b>

You'll find this in Wii Settings > Internet > Console Information.

## Creating your LetterBomb
Now it's time to create your LetterBomb. 

Head over to <a href="http://please.hackmii.com" target="_blank">please.hackmii.com</a>

Select your System Menu Version then enter your consoles MAC Address.

Leave 'Bundle the HackMii Installer for me!' selected.

Confirm you're not a robot then click 'Cut the red wire'.

> Once LetterBomb.zip has downloaded, open the file and extract it to the root of your SD Card.
{.is-info}

---

## Executing the exploit
All of the prep work is now done. At this point, you won't need to use your computer again.

Make sure your Wii is plugged in and powered on. 

Take your SD card, and put it into the Wii SD Card slot.

Head over to the Wii Menu and click the envelope icon in the bottom-right corner. 

You'll now see a single envelope. Click left to browse back one day. 

Now click the LetterBomb message and it will execute the exploit.

<br>
<center><img src="/guide-assets/administrator-assets/wii-jailbreak-letterbomb/images/hackmii.webp" height=""></center>

Choose 'Install The Homebrew Channel', then confirm your choice with 'Yes, continue'. 

> It is heavily advised that you also install BootMii / PriiLoader at this point as it's an important brick protection software. 
{.is-warning}

When it's finished, click continue.

---

## Finished

If everything went well, you should now be running LetterBomb with the Homebrew Channel!
