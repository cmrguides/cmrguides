# Contributors Guide

## Welcome to cmrguides
> Please read through this information carefully before you start writing guides. 
{.is-info}

> <b>Important Contributors Notice - Piracy:</b> 
<br>cmrguides does not and will never endorse piracy. Developers work incredibly hard on games and content and piracy is currently killing these wonderful people. Your guides should activley reflect this ethic. You should not knowingly link to or provide any copyrighted material. We will check this periodically and remove it immediatley if this occurs.<br>
> There is a big difference between modifying and exploiting the hardware you own; taking advantage of development weaknesess, and using the modifications to execute pirated material. We need to maintain this ethic in order to keep our site & community running leagally and fairly. <br>
> If you're in any doubt, please contact us. 
{.is-danger}



<b><font color="green">We're glad to have you on-board! We hope to make cmrguides the biggest and best centre for console modding & repair tutorials.</font></b> 

In order for us to do this, we need as much help from the community as we can get, which is why we're incredibly grateful for the contributions that you'll make to cmrguides. 

---
We want you to develop your own little community within ours. Feel free to create your own identity within your guides so that people recognise your and your work. Add personalised CSS styles to your posts along with customised signatures / footers and build your own unique writing style. 

##### You can download a PSD / TIF template for your signature <a href="/contributor_signature_template.zip" download>here</a>!


<b>This guide will help you to start writing guides, and explain the cmrguides guidelines in more detail.</b>

> We are trusting you with certain site wide permissions. One of these permissions allows you to edit all pages and content across the site. <b>YOU MUST ONLY EDIT YOUR PAGES!</b> We can see activley see who modified pages and when it was carried out. If you modify any pages that do not belong you to, your contributors account and status will be revoked immediately! If this should ever happen, a backup can be instantly loaded to revert these actions. 
{.is-warning}

## Getting familiar
So, you should already have your account setup (hence reading this). This page is only available to contributors and administrators, so if you can see this, then you're ready to start!

It's best to familiarise. yourself with the site first. All you really need to take note of this the sites navigation bar, found in the top-right corner. 
<br>
<img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/d9/a7/sUpEi9Oj_o.png">

The first option will allow you edit a current guide (if you have permission to do so). The second option will allow you to create a guide (you'll use this alot). The third option will take you to a settings page (if you have permission to do so) and the fourth option allows you to modify your accout settings. 

---

## Starting your guide
Once you've clicked the second option in the nav-bar, you'll be presented with the following:
<br>

This is where you can name your guide in the directories. 

> <b>You must select the 'contributors' directory and name your guide.</b> 
The format should be as follows: yourguidename. 
{.is-warning}

## Choosing your editor
Once you've chosen a name, click the 'Select' button. You'll then be presented with the following dialogue:

The fantastic thing about wikijs (the software we use), is the ability to be able to choose between different editors. 

This means regardless of experience, you'll be able to create your guides with ease. 

The options available to you are:
- <b>Markdown</b> (A common language used for creating wiki entries. Perfect for creating your guides & used by us). 
- <b>Visual Editor</b> (Perfect for those who might not know any code or prefer a visual environment). 
- <b>AsciiDoc</b> (A felxible markup language which is slightly more advanced).
- <b>Code</b> (A bare-bones code editor for those who wish to ceate guides within their own editors, then copy them over to cmrguids for publication). 
- <b>From Template</b> (A method to create a guide using another previously made guide as a template. 

> If you choose the 'From Template' option, you must choose once of your own guides as a template. <br>
<b>We do not endorse plagiarism.</b> <br>
If you've had written permission from another contributor to use their guide as a template, you must make either Reece or James aware of this prior. 
{.is-info}

We simply recommend choosing 'Markdown' or 'Visual Editor' as these are simplest options to get going.

## Writing your guide
Once you've selected your editing environment, you should be farmiliar with it's layout and style. From this point you can start writing. 

There are a couple of feature to note. When using 'Markdown' all editing features will be available for use. These may be available in other editors, but these have not been tested. 

Consider using 'Block Quotes' for effect:

> Blockquote Standard

> Blockquote Information
{.is-info}


> Blockquote Success
{.is-success}


> Blockquote Warning
{.is-warning}


> Blockquote Error
{.is-danger}

They're great of emphasising parts of your guide!

Line breaks can be useful for signalling the end of a section.

You can also wrap code if required:

```Here is some important code that I've wrapped!```
``` 
You can also
wrap code
on different lines 
aswell!
```

## Using images in your guide
You can use images anywhere you like throughout your guide. 

We don't allow hosting images directly due to limited server space, however you can host images externally. 

You'll find that 'Markdown' also supports native HTML, meaning you can input images as you would using the image tag but, you can also use the 'Import Image' feature in the left hand 'Markdown' bar to fetch your images from a source. 

We use https://imgbox.com/ to host our images which seems to work fine. They also have an album feature which allows you to sort everything neatly. You can link directly to the images uploaded. 

Feel free to use an image host of your choice. 

> <b>Please Note:</b> All images must never expire, so ensure you select that option on your image host. If an image expires, we will notify you. You'll then need to update this as soon as possible. If no response is received, your guide will be archived.
{.is-warning}

You can also use embeded media in your guide such as YouTube videos and other externally hosted media. 

All images you upload should remain appropriate for everyone. Any inappropriate images or media will be deleted, and your guide will be archived!

---

## Submitting your guide for approval
Once you've completed your guide, you'll need to submit it for approval. You can do this by alerting either Reece or James using Discord or by emailing them and simply telling us what you called it. 

Once we've approved your guide, we'll assign it a category and link in the main website naviagtion area. 

> <b>You must keep your guide up to date!</b> It is your responsibility to do this if anything changes. If your guide falls out of date and is not corrected, it will be removed and archvied!
{.is-warning}

## Happy writing...
Thats it! That's all you should need to know for now. Please use this guide as a reference when creating your own. As we mentioned at the start, please get creative. 

We encourage you to:
- Create your own unique identity within cmrguides.
- Use CSS styling across all of your guides so they recognisable. 
- Create your own footer or signature to place at the bottom of your guide, providing a contact point for users to ask questions about your guide. 
- Advertise your services (providing they are related to the guide in question and do not conflict with cmrguides). 
- Push your guides beyond limit! What we've told you is only the start, get as creative with your guide design as you like. 
- Please please PLEASE, have fun! This community wouldn't have any chance of success without you, so please enjoy what you do.
