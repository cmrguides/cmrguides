# Nintendo DS
The Nintendo DS was an awesome portable handheld. Did you know with jailbreaking you could play games like Galaga 90', Sonic, DOOM, Flappy Bird, Minecraft, some DSiWare, and so much more! You can also experience the awesomeness of homebrew apps! What if you could (insert here). Well you CAN!
