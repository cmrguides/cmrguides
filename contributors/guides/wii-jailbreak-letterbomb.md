# Wii Jailbreak Guide - LetterBomb
<!--START GUIDE CONTENT UNDER THIS LINE-->
## Introduction
<b>This guide will show you how to load LetterBomb, install the Homebrew Channel & jailbreak your Wii.</b>

> This method should work with both the original wii (with GC ports), and the second revision (without GC ports).
<br><b>It will not work on the Wii Mini.</b> 
{.is-info}

## Things you'll need
Before starting you'll need to ensure you have:
- An SD Card which is 4GB or larger.
- A computer with an SD card reader or a USB SD card reader.
- A Wi-Fi connection for your Wii to connect to.

## Preparing the SD Card
To start, you'll need to prepare your SD Card so that the Wii can read it. To do this, you'll need to format the SD Card. In this case you'll need to format it using the FAT32 file system. 

> Other file system types will not work!

## Checking your Wii System Software version
Next, you'll need to check your Wii System Software Version. 

<b>This is important, so make a note of this. </b>

Click the Wii button thats on the bottom-left of the Wii menu, then select Wii Settings. You'll see it in the top-right corner.

> It needs to be version 4.3 followed by U, J, E or K. The letters correspond to the region of the console.
{.is-info}

If your system is running an earlier version, you'll need to update this in the settings using Wii System Update.
