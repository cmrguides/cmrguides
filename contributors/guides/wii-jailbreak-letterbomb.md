<!--START GUIDE CONTENT UNDER THIS LINE-->
### Introduction

{.is-info}

### Things you'll need

Before starting you'll need to ensure you have:
- An SD Card which is 4GB or larger.
- A computer with an SD card reader or a USB SD card reader.
- A Wi-Fi connection for your Wii to connect to.
<br>
### Preparing the SD Card
To start, you'll need to prepare your SD Card so that the Wii can read it. To do this, you'll need to format the SD Card. In this case you'll need to format it using the FAT32 file system. 

> Other file system types will not work!
